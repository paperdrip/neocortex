If I want to reach the WSL instance from the Window Host, I need to use the IP address that routed to it. This IP changes everytime when WSL starts.

The command below returns all the IP address belongs to this instance and the first one in the list should be used for accessing from the host.

```
C:\Users\Ronnie.Kwok>wsl hostname -I
172.24.115.21 172.21.0.1 192.168.49.1 172.20.0.1 192.168.59.1 172.17.0.1 172.25.0.1
```
